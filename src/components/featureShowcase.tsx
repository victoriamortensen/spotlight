                  <p>This was perhaps the most complete new feature process Iâ€™ve been exposed to, where I participated in the complete product design flow, from initial idea to actual launch.</p> 
                  <p>The ideation phase was a very dynamic process where we pulled in all stakeholders to foster early collaboration and rapid idea exchange. As we honed in on possible solutions I started an in-depth API research, so we could cement the technical feasibility and scalability of our solution, which was then brainstormed into a variety of deeper solution ideas.</p>
                  <p>The transition from concept to design began with raw sketches from the product, providing a tangible form to our thoughts and discussions. Once we were confident, this was handed off to our lead designer to develop higher fidelity versions. We did multiple rounds of reviews in collaboration with the wider product team to ensure technical feasibility and that the requirements as initially exposed were kept intact.</p>
                  <p>Once we felt confident with the designs we would collaborate with engineering for ticket creation and development. I actively participated in engineering release and launch to customers and even did parts of the actual CX like product documentation for customers.</p>
                  <p>And as it went live, I kept a constant eye for new escalations from the support team, to spot possible issues with the release and produce tickets for any hotfixes if necessary.</p>
                  <p>Throughout this entire process, I involved all internal stakeholders maintaining open lines of communication to ensure everyone involved was aligned, informed, and engaged with the project's progress and success.</p>

                  <p>Improve the overall design and flow of how we would ingest and manage inventory data.</p> 
                  <p>Every store which we would engage with would arrive with its own unique design and processes for inventory management, which could be simple various formatted Excel sheets to platforms for which we needed custom integrations. Our system in collaboration with the AM team had to clean/perfect that data before those items could be sold. </p>
                  <p>Our process and system we initially had in place were overly dependent on human processes and common sense along the way, which made it costly (time spent) and error-prone. This allowed me to do a host of internal user interviews to locate low-hanging fruit for machine optimization and design a new UX around this workflow.</p>
                  <p>Applying a focus where I would positively separate, in my ideas and Figma design, the item ingest and the overall item management, while trying to envision how the day-to-day work could increase the quality of the store item dataset while helping enrich our golden data set at the same time.</p>
